# GIS-Assignment

(Interactive Synth Pad Demo)[https://sabinecelina.github.io/GIS-Abgabe/]

This project, developed during the 2nd semester in the course "Grundlagen Interaktiver Systeme," involved creating an interactive synthesizer pad using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to play sounds by interacting with a visual interface, where mouse movements and clicks dynamically adjust sound frequency and volume. Additionally, animated circles visualize user interaction, enhancing the experience with real-time graphics. The project demonstrates foundational skills in web development, DOM manipulation, and audio programming.
